"""End-to-end clip analysis.

    video -> frames -> (pose landmarks | picture motion) -> measurements
          -> factor scores -> overall indicator -> plain-language observation

Two pipelines are supported and the best available one is chosen per clip:

* ``dog-pose``      RT-DETR dog boxes and ViTPose++ COCO-17 output. The
                    checkpoint has no AP-10K canine keypoint head, so gait metrics
                    that require that schema remain unavailable.
* ``opencv-motion`` frame-to-frame picture change only. Used whenever torch,
                    transformers, or the weights are unavailable, or when pose
                    throws. The request still returns a result.

The returned dictionary matches the ``AnalyzeResult`` schema in
`lib/api-spec/openapi.yaml`, so the API server can validate it before replying.
