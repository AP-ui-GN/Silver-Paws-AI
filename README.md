# SilverPaws AI

SilverPaws AI helps pet owners notice observable changes in how a companion
walks. You save a pet profile, upload a short clip, and the app returns
**measured movement values**, **factor scores you can read**, and a
**plain-language note**. It is a wellness observation tool, not a veterinary
diagnosis.

## Problem

Owners often notice “something looks different” on walks but have no record of
what changed. SilverPaws turns a short video into a dated note they can compare
over time and, if needed, take to a veterinarian.

## Major features

- Pet profile (name, species, breed, age, weight, notes) stored in this browser
- Walking-clip upload with file, size, and duration checks
- Computer vision pipeline: frame-to-frame picture motion on every clip, and
  a dog box plus 17 COCO joints when torch and the weights are installed
- Measurements kept separate from interpretation. This pose head does not
  measure stride length, because it has no neck and no base of the tail
- Transparent factor scores (consistency, symmetry, mobility, activity, and
  change from the previous walk) blended into an overall 0–100 indicator
- Rule-based observation text that only quotes measured values
- Optional language-model rewrite when `SILVERPAWS_LLM_URL` and
  `SILVERPAWS_LLM_MODEL` are set; otherwise the rule-based note is shown
- History of saved observations, PDF report, and a veterinarian prompt when
  a change looks concerning

## Architecture

```text
Web UI (React)  →  API (Express)  →  Python pipeline (gait_engine)
                         ↓
                   localStorage  →  dashboard / history
```

| Layer | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Web frontend | `artifacts/silverpaws-beta` |
| API | `artifacts/api-server` |
| Shared contracts | `lib/api-spec`, `lib/api-zod`, `lib/api-client-react` |
| Analysis / CV | `gait_engine/` |
| Database (future) | `lib/db` (schema stub only; beta uses `localStorage`) |

Human-facing code (routing, forms, storage, charts) stays in the frontend.
Pose detection, feature math, scoring, and explanation live behind the API.

## AI components

The wording for each step lives in `lib/ai-use/registry.json` and is copied
into the web app by `node scripts/sync-ai-use.mjs`. The generated page is
`docs/AI_USE.md`. Pose limits are in `docs/MODEL_CARD.md`.

- **RT-DETR** finds the dog. **ViTPose++** estimates 17 animal keypoints on
  the analysis server when torch and the weights are installed. How accurate
  that is on pet dogs is still unproven. Low confidence is reported as
  “not measured”, not as a perfect score.
- **OpenCV frame difference** runs on every clip. It is not a learned model.
  When pose is missing, it is the only movement measurement. When pose runs,
  it still supplies movement consistency and activity. Results from different
  pipelines are never mixed in a chart.
- **Scores and the note** come from fixed formulas and templates in
  `gait_engine/wellness.py`. They are not an AI model.
- **Optional language-model rewrite** in
  `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/explanation.ts`, only when
  `SILVERPAWS_LLM_URL` and `SILVERPAWS_LLM_MODEL` are set. Invalid rewrites
  are discarded. The rule-based note is shown instead.
- **Development.** Parts of this app's code and documentation were written
  with AI coding assistants and reviewed by the team. That fact is not a step
  that runs on a clip.

## Limitations

- Does not diagnose injury, pain, or disease
- Does not replace a veterinarian
- Not for emergencies
- One camera angle of one short clip is not a full picture of a pet
- The pose checkpoint is not validated on a labeled set of pet dogs. Its only
  keypoint head is 17 COCO joints. See `docs/MODEL_CARD.md`
- Beta data stays in this browser (`localStorage`), not a shared database

## How to run

Needs **Node.js 20+**, **pnpm**, and **Python 3.10–3.12** with OpenCV.

```bash
pnpm install
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-opencv.txt
```

`requirements-opencv.txt` pins OpenCV and NumPy for Python 3.10–3.12. That
path measures picture motion only and labels the result `opencv-motion`.

For dog pose, install the CPU torch stack (Python 3.10–3.12) and warm the
weight cache so the first request does not download it:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/cache_models.py
```

See `docs/MODEL_CARD.md` for what each model is and what it cannot do.

One clip, without the API:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_clip.py path/to/walk.mp4 --pet-name Mabel
python scripts/analyze_clip.py path/to/walk.mp4 --no-pose
python scripts/check_pose_backend.py path/to/walk.mp4 --out outputs/pose-check/
```

`--no-pose` keeps the OpenCV motion result. The pose-review images use the
checkpoint's COCO names. Do not commit the clip or `outputs/`.

Tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test
pnpm --filter @workspace/silverpaws-beta run test
```

On October 22, 2026 those were 73 Python tests, 37 API tests, and 17 web
tests, all passing. The pose head was not validated by those counts.

Start both services (two terminals):

```bash
# terminal 1 — analysis API (port 8080)
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev

# terminal 2 — app (port 4173), proxies /api to the server
pnpm --filter @workspace/silverpaws-beta run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4173

To run the API in Docker, see `docs/HOSTING.md`. The image was not built in
this repository checkout.

### On a phone on the same Wi-Fi

The web dev script already uses `--host 0.0.0.0`. With both services running,
a phone on the same network can open `http://<laptop-ip>:4173`. Use **Record
walk** on the Analyze page to hand the clip to the phone camera through the
file picker. The page does not open the camera itself.

Optional environment variables:

| Variable | Where | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | API / Vite | `8080` / `4173` | Listen port |
| `BASE_PATH` | Vite | `/` | Public path prefix |
| `API_PROXY_TARGET` | Vite | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Dev proxy for `/api` |
| `SILVERPAWS_PYTHON` | API | project `.venv` if present | Python used to run the pipeline |
| `SILVERPAWS_REPO_ROOT` | API | inferred | Repo root so the CLI can be found |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | API | `60` | Upload size cap |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | API | localhost Vite origins outside production; empty in production | Comma-separated exact browser origins for the deployed web app |
| `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS` | API | `600000` | Stop the pipeline after this many milliseconds. Motion saved before pose is returned if pose is still running |
| `ANALYZE_MAX_CONCURRENT` | API | `2` | Pipelines running at once. Extra uploads are refused before the body is read |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | API | unset | Set to `1` only behind a proxy that sets `X-Forwarded-Proto` |
| `SILVERPAWS_LLM_URL` | API | unset | Optional chat-completions endpoint |
| `SILVERPAWS_LLM_KEY` | API | unset | Bearer token for that endpoint; never logged |
| `SILVERPAWS_LLM_MODEL` | API | unset | Model name. Required, with the URL, before a rewrite is attempted |

No API keys are required for the app to analyze a clip.

For local CORS defaults and production browser-origin configuration, see
`.env.example` and `docs/HOSTING.md`. In production, set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
to the exact HTTPS origin(s) of the web app. CORS is not authentication.

## How teammates can contribute

Read `TEAM_TASKS.md`. Each unfinished task points at one file and lists
completion criteria. Do not rewrite working UI or pipeline code to start a
task — extend the function or component that is already marked.
