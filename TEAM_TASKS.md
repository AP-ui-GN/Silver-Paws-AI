# TEAM TASKS

These workstreams are left unfinished on purpose so each teammate can write
real code. Do not replace them with dummy implementations.

The markers in the listed files look like:

# ==================================================
# TEAM TASK: SUDARSHAN
# PURPOSE:
# Finish the quality-of-life scoring model.
# ==================================================

TEAM MEMBER: Sudarshan
TASK: Score mobility and historical change, then calibrate the weights
FILE / MODULE: `gait_engine/wellness.py` (`mobility_factor`, `historical_change_factor`, `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS`)
WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:
- `mobility_factor(measurements)` — return a 0–100 score (or `None`) from pose measurements the pipeline already saves: `hipStability`, `leftAnkleMotion`, `rightAnkleMotion`, `strideSymmetry`.
- `historical_change_factor(overall, previous_overall)` — turn the change against the previous saved walk into a 0–100 factor, or `None` on a first walk. The pipeline already calls this after the overall score is computed (`gait_engine/pipeline.py`).
- Add `"mobility"` and `"historicalChange"` entries to `DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` once those functions return real scores. Until a weight exists, `overall_score()` ignores that factor.
- Review `CONCERNING_DROP` and `CONCERNING_ASYMMETRY`. Decide whether those thresholds still make sense.
- Keep `build_observation()` honest: it may only mention measured values.
WHY IT MATTERS:
- This is the analytical heart of the product. Owners should be able to see *why* a score moved.
DEPENDENCIES:
- Measurements already produced by `gait_engine/pipeline.py` and `gait_engine/features.py`
- Tests in `tests/test_wellness.py` (add cases for the new scores)
COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- Mobility and historical change are scored when the clip supports them, and left as `None` otherwise
- Weights are documented and easy to change
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .` still passes
- Observation text never invents a number or a diagnosis

# ==================================================
# TEAM TASK: KAVIN
# PURPOSE:
# Finish the trend view, form validation, and selected tests.
# ==================================================

TEAM MEMBER: Kavin
TASK: Historical trends, validation messages, and a testing checklist
FILE / MODULE:
- `artifacts/silverpaws-beta/src/components/trend-panel.tsx` (web) and `mobile/src/components/trend-panel.tsx` (phone)
- `artifacts/silverpaws-beta/src/pages/pet.tsx` (web) and `mobile/app/pet/[id].tsx` (phone)
- `TESTING.md`
WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:
1. **Trend panel** — replace the placeholder in `trend-panel.tsx` with a real comparison of saved walks. Show date, overall score, movement consistency, and symmetry. Only compare records that share the same `pipeline` (`movenet` vs `opencv-motion`). Handle empty, one-walk, and many-walk states. Do not invent chart data. Start with the web version; the phone version receives the same `analyses` prop (already newest-first), so the same logic ports over with React Native `View`/`Text` instead of HTML.
2. **Pet form validation** — in `pet.tsx` / `pet/[id].tsx`, show a visible message when name is blank, or when age/weight is present but not a positive number. Do not save until those checks pass. (The phone form disables Save on a blank name; the age/weight messages are still yours.)
3. **Testing** — add a short automated check (Playwright, Vitest, or a node test) for one of: pet save, clip-type rejection, or history empty state. Update the checklist in `TESTING.md`.
WHY IT MATTERS:
- Owners need to see direction over time, not a single number, and the form should explain itself when something is wrong.
DEPENDENCIES:
- Saved analysis fields in `src/lib/storage.ts` (`createdAt`, `overallScore`, `factors`, `pipeline`)
- History page already mounts `<TrendPanel analyses={analyses} />`
COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- Trend panel uses only saved records
- Invalid pet input shows a message the user can act on
- At least one automated UI/unit test is documented in `TESTING.md` and can be run locally

# ==================================================
# TEAM TASK: ABHI
# PURPOSE:
# Connect the optional language-model rewrite, then harden the live path.
# ==================================================

TEAM MEMBER: Abhi
TASK: Provider request for the explanation rewrite, plus integration checks
FILE / MODULE: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/explanation.ts` (`requestModelRewrite`)
WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:
- Send `buildExplanationPrompt(context)` to the configured chat-completions endpoint.
- Read `SILVERPAWS_LLM_URL`, `SILVERPAWS_LLM_KEY`, and `SILVERPAWS_LLM_MODEL`.
- Abort a slow request. Return `null` (never throw) on any provider error.
- Never log the API key.
- Leave `validateExplanation()` and the rule-based fallback alone — they already reject invented numbers, diagnoses, certainty language, and dropped vet recommendations.
- After the rewrite works, run a live clip through UI → API → pipeline and record the result in `TESTING.md`.
WHY IT MATTERS:
- A model may only *rephrase* measured findings. The product must stay usable when the provider is missing or returns junk.
DEPENDENCIES:
- Rule-based observation from `gait_engine/wellness.py`
- Validation tests in `artifacts/api-server/tests/explanation.test.ts`
COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- With no env vars set, the app still returns the rule-based observation (`usedLlm: false`)
- With a provider configured, a validated rewrite can replace that text (`usedLlm: true`)
- An invalid rewrite is discarded and the fallback is shown
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test` still passes

# ==================================================
# TEAM TASK: PRODUCT / RESEARCH
# PURPOSE:
# Keep the wording observational.
# ==================================================

TEAM MEMBER: All three
TASK: Review user-facing copy and disclaimers
FILE / MODULE: `artifacts/silverpaws-beta/src/lib/disclaimers.ts`, observation text, report PDF
WHAT TO IMPLEMENT:
- Confirm the app never claims a diagnosis or emergency role
- Confirm a concerning change points to a veterinarian
WHY IT MATTERS:
- Trust depends on honest language.
DEPENDENCIES:
- Current copy in the footer, history detail, and PDF report
COMPLETION CRITERIA:
- A stranger reading the app can tell this is a wellness note, not a medical result
