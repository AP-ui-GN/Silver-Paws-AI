# Model card

SilverPaws measures a walking clip. It does not diagnose pain, injury, or disease.

## What runs

| Pipeline | When | What it measures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dog-pose` | torch, transformers, and the weights load | A dog box, then 17 COCO joints. This checkpoint has no AP-10K head. |
| `opencv-motion` | pose cannot run, or pose throws | Frame-to-frame picture change only |

New results do not use the older human-pose pipeline name. Saved walks that
used it still validate.

**Dog detector.** `PekingU/rtdetr_r50vd_coco_o365` (`RTDetrForObjectDetection`).
The model card on Hugging Face lists Apache-2.0. The dog class id is read
from `config.id2label`. It is not hard-coded. A box is kept at
`DOG_DETECT_THRESHOLD` 0.3.

**Pose.** `usyd-community/vitpose-plus-base` (`VitPoseForPoseEstimation`).
The Transformers docs list dataset index 3 as an AP-10K backbone expert.
The checkpoint file has one keypoint head. `config.id2label` and
`config.edges` are the 17 COCO human joints. Index 4 is `R_Ear`. The
original ViTPose++ training config defines a separate AP-10K head, and that
head is not in this file. Passing dataset index 3 does not change the
channel order.

On one side-view frame, channel 0 sat on the nose and channel 4 sat on the
ear, next to the head, not at the base of the tail. The pipeline therefore
names these channels with the COCO schema. It does not call channel 4
`root_of_tail`. Stride length, which needs the neck and the base of the
tail, stays unmeasured.

The loaded file has one decoder. Its last convolution has 17 output
channels. `config.id2label` is Nose through R_Ankle. The backbone config
has six experts. Dataset index 3 only selects one of those experts.

## Side-view review

This is one clip, not a validation set. `scripts/check_pose_backend.py` on
that clip sampled 60 frames at 960×544 and printed `schema=coco-17`,
`dogFramesShare=1.0`, `multipleDogs=False`, and `personPresent=True`. The
right ear's median was 91.0 px from the nose and 352.6 px from the left hip.
Both ankles were below the hips.

The dog box stays on the dog. A person at the left edge is recorded as
present and is not returned as the dog. The nose tracks the snout as the
dog walks left. On the drawn frames the nose, eyes, and ears sit on the
head, the shoulders sit on the withers, and the elbows, wrists, knees, and
ankles sit on the legs. Left and right are not a dog's left and right: the
median left and right eyes were 11.1 px apart, and the ears were 5.4 px
apart. On some frames the rear-leg links cross, and both hips can land on
the same part of the rump. The tail in the picture has no landmark.

Do not rename a channel to force a nose-farther-than-eyes rule or a
nose-to-tail rule. This head has no neck and no base of the tail. Those
stride numbers stay unmeasured until a checkpoint with an AP-10K keypoint
head is checked on its own.

Both models run on the server. The browser only uploads the clip.

## What is not validated

- Pose quality on a labeled set of pet dogs. One side-view frame was compared with `config.id2label`. Channel 4 is the right ear (91.0 px from the nose, 352.6 px from the left hip on that frame). That is a naming check, not a validation set.
- Left versus right on a side view. `left_knee` on that frame scored 0.38.
- Stride length from this head. It has no neck and no base of the tail, so those numbers stay unmeasured.
- Stride symmetry as a clinical measure
- Any link between a score and pain, injury, or disease

Placeholder peak, spacing, and phase cutoffs are in `docs/GAIT_METRICS.md`.

## Fallback

If torch, transformers, or the weights are missing, or pose throws, the clip
is still measured with OpenCV frame difference. `diagnostics.poseSkipReason`
says why. The request does not fail because pose failed.

## Cache

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/cache_models.py
```

Weights go to `HF_HOME`, default `models/hf`. That directory is gitignored.

## Time and memory

On this CPU, a 15.000-second 30 fps file made by repeating a 5-second clip
took 40.127 seconds end to end (`scripts/time_clip.py`: sample 0.949 s,
pose including weight load 39.162 s, gait math 0.015 s). Peak RSS was
1665.3 MB. One-shot `analyze_clip.py` on the same file took 37.543 seconds.
Loading both models in a new process, without a clip, took 4.02 seconds of
wall time. The Docker image was not built, so hosted RAM is not measured.
Details are in `docs/HOSTING.md`.
