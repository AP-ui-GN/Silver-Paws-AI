# How AI is used in SilverPaws

SilverPaws can use a dog detector and a pose model to find body points in a clip. Every clip also gets a standard frame-to-frame motion measurement. Scores and the note come from fixed formulas. An optional language model can reword the note when the server is configured for it; it cannot change the numbers. This checkpoint's pose head outputs 17 COCO joint names and does not output the neck or the base of the tail. Pose quality on pet dogs is unproven until a labeled set is measured.

This page is generated from `lib/ai-use/registry.json`. Edit that file and run `node scripts/sync-ai-use.mjs`. Do not edit the copies by hand.

Pose landmarks are described further in `docs/MODEL_CARD.md`.

## dog-detector

**What it is.** RT-DETR, PekingU/rtdetr_r50vd_coco_o365, an object detector. The model card license is Apache-2.0.

**What it does.** When torch and the weights are installed, the server finds dog boxes in sampled frames. The dog class id is read from the model labels. It also notes when a person box is present. That note is informational.

**What it doesn't do.** It does not name a condition, decide which leg is weaker, or choose the wellness score.

Code: `gait_engine/pose_backend.py`

## pose-model

**What it is.** ViTPose++ base, usyd-community/vitpose-plus-base. Dataset index 3 selects a backbone expert. The only keypoint head in this checkpoint is the 17-channel COCO head. It does not emit AP-10K neck or root-of-tail points.

**What it does.** When torch and the weights are installed, the server estimates those 17 COCO joints inside the dog box. Each point has a position and a confidence. The names match the checkpoint labels. Stride length is not measured from this head.

**What it doesn't do.** It outputs positions and confidences only. It does not name a condition, detect pain, or choose the wellness score. A low score is not stored as a measurement.

Code: `gait_engine/pose_backend.py`

## motion-fallback

**What it is.** Standard OpenCV frame-difference analysis. This is not a learned model.

**What it does.** The server compares consecutive frames and records how much the picture changed. This runs on every clip. When pose is unavailable, it is the only movement measurement. When pose runs, this measurement still supplies movement consistency and activity.

**What it doesn't do.** It does not find limbs or keypoints, and it is not an AI model.

Code: `gait_engine/motion.py`

## scoring

**What it is.** Fixed formulas and weights in the wellness module.

**What it does.** Turns the measured values into factor scores and one overall indicator from 0 to 100. A missing measurement is left out. It is not treated as zero.

**What it doesn't do.** No AI model chooses or adjusts these scores.

Code: `gait_engine/wellness.py`

## observation-rules

**What it is.** Sentence templates in the wellness module.

**What it does.** Builds the plain-language note from the measured values and the scores.

**What it doesn't do.** It does not invent numbers, name a condition, or call a language model.

Code: `gait_engine/wellness.py`

## llm-rewrite

**What it is.** An optional language-model call on the analysis server.

**What it does.** When SILVERPAWS_LLM_URL and SILVERPAWS_LLM_MODEL are set, the server asks that provider to rephrase the rule-based note. The reply is shown only if it passes validation.

**What it doesn't do.** It is off when those variables are unset. It cannot add a measurement, name a condition, or drop a veterinarian recommendation. A failed or invalid reply is discarded and the rule-based note is shown.

Code: `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/explanation.ts`

## development

**What it is.** AI coding assistants used while building the app.

**What it does.** Parts of this app's code and documentation were written with AI coding assistants and reviewed by the team.

**What it doesn't do.** This is not a model that runs on a clip. It does not measure a pet or write the note an owner sees from a walk. The team lead confirms this entry's final wording before release.

Code: the repository as a whole, not one clip.
